# squawk

I made this one late night for my sister to help her study for an ornithology test. Pulls MP3s from www.allaboutbirds.org to create a randomized, interactive quiz.

##Usage
1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Populate [birdlist.yaml](https://github.com/MortimerMcMire315/squawk/blob/master/birdlist.yaml) as demonstrated with a list of birds separated into categories
3. Run [birdquiz.py](https://github.com/MortimerMcMire315/squawk/blob/master/birdquiz.py) with Python 3.

##Dependencies
* PyYAML >=3.12
* Requests >=2.13.0
